    <h1>Hi Ruby!</h1>
    <p>
        Thank you for visiting this little site.<br>
        I made this as a landing-page to allow you to access what I made for you...
    </p>
    <p>
        It's a small little game. You can download the EXE here:<br>
        <a href="8bitruby.exe">DOWNLOAD for Windows</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        But I understand if you don't want to just run a random EXE on your computer.
        For that case, I created a version that should run in your browser. To access it, just click:<br>
        <a href="8bitruby.html">START GAME in browser</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        I hope it works. I tested it with Chrome on Windows 10 and Safari on MacOS.<br>

        Enjoy!
    </p>
